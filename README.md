# Woomïnstaller GX2

Homebrew package installer for Wii U

##Compiling Notes
Compilation requires [makefst](https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/makefst), [WUT](https://github.com/decaf-emu/wut), and DevKitPPC portlibs to be installed. The generated output is a .woomy package and a woominstaller\_gx2\_out folder with raw FST contents.

##Usage Notes
This application requires access to texture2D.gsh from either Health and Safety or in content/. This can either be provided through custom firmwares which properly loosen file permissions or by changing the permissions of /vol/storage_mlc01/sys/title/00050010/1004EX00/content/shader/texture2D.gsh to RW for all applications (where X is 0, 1 or 2 depending on the Wii U region). This is due to using GPU acceleration through GX2 while there is no publically accessible GX2 shader compiler (an LLVM-based compiler *may* be possible in the future). The current alternative would be to build in shaders generated by Nintendo's SDK, which is potentially illegal.
